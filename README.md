#Fledgling Maker

A quick and dirty blog site run by Chris Stack to document various DIY projects and other things that may be of interest to other nerdy people.


The base of Fledgling Maker is a fork of Jekyll Now.


**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))


Jekyll Now is even simpler then Jekyll because no setup is required. Just fork the repository here:([Jekyll Now Repository]( https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)) and follow the directions to get started.
